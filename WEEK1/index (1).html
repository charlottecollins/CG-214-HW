I am a <b>Direct and Interactive Marketing Student</b> at the Fashion Institute. I am taking this class because I have a <b> Creative Technology minor.</b> What I like best about being in New York is that there are so many opportunities, you can mold your future limitlessly.</p>

<li>Boulder, CO</li>
<li>Seattle, WA</li>
<li>Somewhere in Cali</li>
