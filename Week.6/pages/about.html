<font color="#FFFFFF" face="helvetica"> <p class="blocktext">Every time I think about my lifestyle or the message I wish I could tell the whole world, I'd like to remind them how blessed we are to live in a balanced, nourishing ecosystem. Humans may factually be the dominant species, but the 'dominant social paradigm' has really just led us to be destructive to the world, particularly nature, which we forget we are synonymous with.</p> 

<p class="blocktext">I decided to use this project as a minimal outlet of these feelings (minimal because I am a beginner at this) and write a Haiku with some of my own personal images that demonstrate how beautiful our planet is that we are part of.</p>

<p class="blocktext"> A quick note in case you don't remember grade school english, a Haiku is a Japanese poem with
	three lines; the first and last lines have 5 syllables, and the middle line has 7.</p> 

<p class="blocktext">The mindset that progress = growth is pretty much how we arrived at the global climate crisis. Everything is about money and consumption. I can't picture the world evolving in a different way because this is how things are, but I'm so curious what that would be like. </p></font></div>
